# Adoption Website

# Description
This project is a learning exercise to practice the execution of developing a single page application. The topics of development that were needed to create this assignment included:dynamic  DOM manipulation using different JavaScript loops, event listeners, querySelectors, and conditionals. Cards were to be printed to the DOM by looping through an object array containing different types of pets.
# User Information
The user for this application is someone interested in adopting a pet. They are given various attributes of each pet such as their name, color, and special skill. The user can then use buttons located at the top of the page to filter the different pets by type: Dog, Cat, Dinosaur or all pets. The user also has the ability to click on the delete button of each card to remove that particular card off the web page, if they are not interested.   
# Features
- Buttons at the top of the page that allow users to filter pets based on the type of pet.
- A delete button on each pet card that allows the user to remove pets they are uninterested in from the page.
